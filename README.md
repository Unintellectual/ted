# TED

Ted is a simple terminal text editor made in C programming language based on antirez's [kilo](http://antirez.com/news/108). With extra features implemented such as:

- Syntax Highlighting
- Find

## To install and use Ted:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Unintellectual/ted.git
    $ cd ted
    $ make
    $ ./ted



## This is a pet project and I do not intend to make upgrade this even further.
